"""

In Python, __doc__ is a built-in attribute of classes, functions, modules, and methods that returns the 
documentation string (docstring) associated with the object. A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, 
function, class, or method definition, and is used to document what the object does and how to use it.
